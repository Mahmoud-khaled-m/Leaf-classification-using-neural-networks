# Leaf-classification-using-neural-networks
In this project, I utilized the Leaf Classification dataset to develop a neural network-based classification system for identifying different types of leaves. The primary objective was to build an accurate and efficient model capable of classifying leaves based on their unique characteristics.

I successfully designed and implemented a neural network architecture specifically tailored for leaf classification. The neural network was trained using the Leaf Classification dataset, which provided a diverse range of leaf samples. Through the training process, I optimized the network's parameters to improve its performance and ensure accurate classification results.

To enhance the model's performance, I manually conducted hyperparameter tuning, systematically adjusting the key parameters of the neural network. This process involved experimenting with various values for parameters such as learning rate, batch size, activation functions, and network depth. By fine-tuning these parameters, I aimed to achieve the best possible accuracy and optimize the model's generalization capabilities.
